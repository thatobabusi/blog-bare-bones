*Note: 

I did this as a side project at home.
It's intended to showcase what I do outside of office hours, as my work code is confidential.

a. Admin side with the above details is working.
b. Public user side is a little faulty, will make time to fix it up.

I would have fixed up the bugs and completed it earlier but I then added a more user friendly UI and began converting it to Codeigniter framework.
Will upload that as soon as I am done with bug fixing.
